# Goaltimate Pickup
This project served as my final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. This app is intended to aid a group of individuals who regularly play pickup games of Goaltimate on weekends to schedule where and when the games will occur.

## Challenges:
This project was a great learning opportunity. One of the biggest challenges I faced was capturing new user information during registration, as Firebase stores emails and passwords separately from the other information I wanted to collect. I dug deeper and deeper into the problem, with no solution in sight. I expressed the frustration and issues I was experiencing with a classmate, who was able to break through the progress barrier I was facing and help get my code functioning. For me, this project highlighted the importance of collaboration, even when doing solo projects.

## What I learned:
* Trying something new is *hard*. I underestimated the amount of time it would take for me to learn how to use Firebase. During this project, I felt very frustrated that I wasn't understanding this quicker. I had decided to use Firebase a day before beginning my project. In the future, I would build in research time to my project plan before committing to use something new.
* It takes much longer to accomplish a full stack app on your own than you anticipate. The previous projects were done with partners with the same timeline, and I operated as if I had someone to share the workload with. In the future, I would better plan my time and be more realistic of what I thinkn I can accomplish.

## In the future, I would like to add:
* A component to visually represent the current status of location and time voting
* Ability for users to update their availability
* Deleting users in games automatically each week
* On screen and text message notification to users to let them know if a game is on or not for the weekend
